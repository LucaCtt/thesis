\section{Physical Twin}

The DT should allow users to add new appliances by automatically importing their consumption values (imagining the existence of a list of devices compatible with the DT whose data will be available at the time of system configuration). Obviously, these values will be indicative and related to the new and perfectly functioning appliance; over time it will be necessary for the DT to learn from the actual consumption because it could change in the event of malfunctions or poor/absent maintenance.

\section{Privacy and Security}

Authentication for the api, user profiles, encryption of the data, secure connection, etc.
