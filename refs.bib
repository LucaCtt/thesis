  abstract = {TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.},

  abstract = {Electric consumption forecasting using smart meter dataset is one of the aspects in which machine learning approach is highly applied. Forecasting peak demand and electric appliance consumption requires detailed analysis of smart meter data through classification and clustering methods. Forecasting of electrical appliance and Peak demand is necessary action and a significant part in electric power system planning and development. However, due to variability of household consumption level demand and appliance consumption demand, deep and detail analysis of customers’ smart meter data is required in order to identify critical attributes and the source of variation between the consumption level of appliance, as well as customers demand. This paper focuses on forecasting levels of electric appliance consumption and peak demand with the life style of residential customer’s using data obtained from Irish and Umass repository. Further on, customers life style is analyzed from the results of customer peak demand forecast. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithm called CLARA clustering, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network are applied as in order to achieve forecast the appliance consumption level and peak demand. Mean electric appliance consumption values are calculated from daily, weekly, monthly and total consumption for each appliance from 1~year smart data of 1~min time interval for electric appliance consumption forecasting of individual households. For the customers’ peak demand consumption, only mean of weekly consumption of aggregated households is computed together. The forecasting of customers electric consumption using SVM provides outcome of 99.6\% accuracy which is much better than the previous works in the same field of study. The obtained result shows that the implemented methodologies and algorithms are applied at their best level of performance.},

These patterns can be used to recognize the inhabitant activity that is useful to enhance the smart home services like energy efficiency service, where these patterns can be used as inhabitant behavior to reduce an unnecessary appliances or lightings usage based on the activities their conduct. Recognition accuracy is important things for providing particular service needs on automation process in smart home, but activity recognition faces many challenges in real world cause of diversity and complexity of the activities. Inter-subject variability activities often appear in real world situation that accuracy of recognition process can be affected. For instance, there is a possible situation where family or colleague visits to inhabitant's home in long term. Non-inhabitant activities may conduct with a different way or different behavior than inhabitant does. This situation is producing activities where is not carried from legitimate inhabitant. In this paper, we propose a method to overcome the activity recognition issue that commonly occurred. Our proposed method using temporal relation approach, which can detect a non-inhabitant activity. This approach is separating detected activities from inhabitant's observed activities, so the activity recognition will perform effectively. We assess the effectiveness of our approach using Activity Daily Living (ADL) provided by WSU Smart Home Project dataset.},

Though, the critical problem is in the design of complex load characteristics, switching operations and a large number of junctions at electrical distribution feeders. To overcome the design challenges, this research conducted an analysis of short-term energy requirement forecasting for district-level by applying into two deep learning models. Present, the booming increase of deep learning (DL) methods give them encouraging options to data-driven techniques. However, DL gives exceptional ability in handling the non-linear complex relations, model computation performance and complexity are of attention.

Therefore, efficient energy management and forecasting energy consumption for buildings are important in decision-making for effective energy saving and development in particular places. This paper reviews the building electrical energy forecasting method using artificial intelligence (AI) methods such as support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Both methods are widely used in the field of forecasting and their aim on finding the most accurate approach is ever continuing. Besides the already existing single method of forecasting, the hybridization of the two forecasting methods has the potential to be applied for more accurate results. Further research works are currently ongoing, regarding the potential of hybrid method of Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), or known as GLSSVM, to forecast building electrical energy consumption.},

To this aim, we introduce a wide survey of existing devices made publicly available for the further analysis of trends and state of the art. This data-driven approach permits developing quantitative insight into the big picture of the current status of IoT nodes. The analysis shows that an order (ultimately two orders) of magnitude gap needs to be filled in terms of size, lifetime, and cost (energy efficiency) to ultimately make IoT nodes truly ubiquitous and trigger the widely expected exponential growth of the IoT ecosystem. Overall, this article presents a view from the edge of the IoT and a glimpse of its tipping point.},

To this direction, the GHOST project, a European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation funded project, aims to develop a reference architecture for securing smart-homes IoT ecosystem. It is required to have automated and user friendly security mechanisms embedded into smart-home environments, to protect the users’ digital well being. GHOST project aims to fulfill this requirement and one of its main functionalities is the traffic monitoring for all IoT related network protocols. In this paper, the traffic capturing and monitoring mechanism of the GHOST system, called NDFA, is presented, as the first mechanism that is able to monitor smart-home activity in a holistic way. With the help of the NDFA, we compile the GHOST-IoT-data-set, an IoT network traffic data-set, captured in a real world smart-home installation. This data-set contains traffic from multiple network interfaces with both normal real life activity and simulated abnormal functioning of the devices. The GHOST-IoT-data-set is offered to the research community as a proof of concept to demonstrate the ability of the NDFA module to process the raw network traffic from a real world smart-home installation with multiple network interfaces and IoT devices.},

  abstract = {The growing availability of smart objects is stimulating researchers to investigate the Internet of Things (IoT) phenomenon from different perspectives. The potential of this technology is evident in different domains. In Cultural Heritage (CH), it may enhance access to CH collections, in order to ensure a more engaging visit experience and to increase the appropriation of CH content by visitors. So far, research on IoT has primarily focused on technical features of smart objects (e.g., how to program sensors and actuators), while there are very few approaches trying to facilitate the adoption of such a technology by end users. This lack limits the social and practical benefits of IoT; it creates barriers in all those usage scenarios where people would like to define the behavior of smart objects but they might not have the required programming skills. This is becoming evident in CH sites, where different stakeholders would benefit from managing ecosystems of interoperable smart objects to create enhanced visit experiences. This article presents a visual composition paradigm that allows non-programmers to synchronize the behavior of smart objects, thus determining more engaging user experiences. It discusses how the paradigm suites the need of curators and guides of CH sites to define smart visit experiences through which visitors can acquire CH content by interacting with the surrounding environment and the smart objects included in it. A serious game designed with professional guides of CH sites is used as a case study to show the potential of the presented approach.},

To this aim, we designed and developed two Amazon Skills (one for Amazon Echo Show and the other for Amazon Echo Dot) and two Google Actions (one for Google Nest Hub and the other for Google Home Speaker). Then, we carried out two controlled experiments, involving 40 participants, to compare routine creation through multi-modal interaction (based on vision, speech, and touch) with routine creation through speech-only interaction. Driven by our research questions, we found that for routine creation the multi-modal interaction is preferred to the speech-only one and the perceived quality of interaction seems to depend on the brand of the smart speaker.},

This paper presents a systematic mapping study aimed at identifying and classifying scientific literature about EUD, EUP and EUSE in the time range January 2000–May 2017. We selected 165 papers found through a manual selection of papers from specific conferences, journal special issues, and books, integrated with an automatic search on the most important digital libraries. The answer to our research question was built through a classification of the selected papers on seven dimensions: type of approach, interaction technique, phase in which the approach is adopted, application domain, target use, class of users, and type of evaluation. Our findings suggest that EUD, EUP and EUSE are active research topics not only in Human–Computer Interaction, but also in other research communities. However, little cross-fertilization exists among the three themes, as well as unifying frameworks and approaches for guiding novice designers and practitioners. Other findings highlight trends and gaps related to the analysis’ dimensions, which have implications on the design of future tools and suggest open issues for further investigations.},

In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed. The design implications derived from the study are then presented: they focus on socio-technical design aspects and DT lifecycle. Open issues and challenges that require to be addressed in the future are finally discussed.},

This work proposes to improve learning algorithms with expert knowledge and proposes a general model using a knowledge driven approach to forecast if a particular appliance will start during a given hour or not. The approach is both a knowledge driven and data driven one. The overall energy management for a house requires that the prediction is done for the next 24h in the future. The proposed model is tested over the IRISE data and using different machine learning algorithms. The results for predicting the next hour consumption are presented, but the model works also for predicting the next 24h.},

Building upon more than a year of experience in sensor network deployments, we undertake an extensive deployment in a three storey home in Delhi, spanning 73 days from May-August 2013, measuring electrical, water and ambient parameters.

  abstract = {Non-intrusive load monitoring, or energy disaggregation, aims to separate household energy consumption data collected from a single point of measurement into appliance-level consumption data. In recent years, the field has rapidly expanded due to increased interest as national deployments of smart meters have begun in many countries. However, empirically comparing disaggregation algorithms is currently virtually impossible. This is due to the different data sets used, the lack of reference implementations of these algorithms and the variety of accuracy metrics employed. To address this challenge, we present the Non-intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit (NILMTK); an open source toolkit designed specifically to enable the comparison of energy disaggregation algorithms in a reproducible manner. This work is the first research to compare multiple disaggregation approaches across multiple publicly available data sets. Our toolkit includes parsers for a range of existing data sets, a collection of preprocessing algorithms, a set of statistics for describing data sets, two reference benchmark disaggregation algorithms and a suite of accuracy metrics. We demonstrate the range of reproducible analyses which are made possible by our toolkit, including the analysis of six publicly available data sets and the evaluation of both benchmark disaggregation algorithms across such data sets.},

  abstract = {Although it is often stated that the energy consumption in buildings accounts for more than 30\% of total global final energy use, only a few studies analyze updated data about the current building energy consumptions or focus on comparing different countries. Similarly, models that predict future trends in building energy demand often use contrasting algorithms which result in diverse forecasts. Scope of this paper is to present and discuss data taken from several studies about the building energy consumptions in US, EU, and BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries and to provide an updated inventory of useful figures. Comparisons among countries are used to show historical, actual, and future energy consumption trends. Data presented by the World Bank, the United Nations Environment Program, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the International Energy Agency are compared with national reports as well as with research studies. The variety of the approaches used in each of the previous sources was considered fundamental to allow a complete review. The paper shows that the total building energy consumptions in BRIC countries have already overcome those in developed countries, and the continuous increase in the building stock of the BRIC countries creates an urgency for promoting building energy efficiency policies in these countries. At the same time, the policies actually adopted in developed countries are insufficient to guarantee a significant reduction in their building energy consumption in the years to come. In the current scenario, at least a doubling of the global energy demand in buildings compared to today’s levels will occur by 2050. To avoid this forecast, cost-effective best practices and technologies as well as behavioral and lifestyle changes need to be diffused and accepted globally.},

  abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising success--they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

This variability arises from differences in home configurations, sensor network setups, and the number and habits of inhabitants, resulting in a lack of data that accurately represent the application environment. Although simulators have been proposed in the literature to generate data, they fail to bridge the gap between training and field data or produce diverse datasets. In this article, we propose a solution to address this issue by leveraging the concept of digital twins to reduce the disparity between training and real-world data and generate more varied datasets. We introduce the Virtual Smart Home, a simulator specifically designed for modeling daily life activities in smart homes, which is adapted from the Virtual Home simulator. To assess its realism, we compare a set of activity data recorded in a real-life smart apartment with its replication in the VirtualSmartHome simulator. Additionally, we demonstrate that an activity recognition algorithm trained on the data generated by the VirtualSmartHome simulator can be successfully validated using real-life field data.},

  abstract = {Well annotated power consumption traces are a crucial prerequisite for the development and analysis of load disaggregation algorithms. Due to the high efforts required to collect such traces in the real world, their synthetic generation has emerged as a viable alternative. However, many current models for the synthetic trace generation simply combine statistical information about household occupancy with the energy consumptions of the most frequently performed user activities. While this may suffice for high-level analyses (i.e., considering groups of households or entire cities), such models do not reflect the actual diversity of consumption signatures in real data. We overcome this limitation in this paper by presenting a system design to model appliance power consumption at a user-definable accuracy. Our Automated Model Builder for Appliance Loads (AMBAL) allows to derive models from real device power consumption data collected by means of smart plugs. These models are represented by sequences of parametrized signatures; each model's complexity is kept minimized for its desired level of accuracy. We evaluate the accuracy of AMBAL's models for device traces with consumption patterns of different complexity, taken from existing appliance-level data sets. Moreover, a synthetic appliance trace generator is presented which allows to recombine appliance models in an effort to simulate user activities in homes with a definable complexity. The generated data is valuable for the development of data analysis algorithms (e.g., Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring), and we integrate it with the NILMTK framework to demonstrate that a similar disaggregation performance is achieved for actual and generated traces.},

First, significant low-cost energy reductions can be made in the residential and commercial sectors, but these savings have not been achievable to date. Second, billions of dollars are being spent to install smart meters, yet the energy saving and financial benefits of this infrastructure – without careful consideration of the human element – will not reach its full potential. We believe that we can address these problems by strategically marrying them, using disaggregation. Disaggregation refers to a set of statistical approaches for extracting end-use and/or appliance level data from an aggregate, or whole-building, energy signal. In this paper, we explain how appliance level data affords numerous benefits, and why using the algorithms in conjunction with smart meters is the most cost-effective and scalable solution for getting this data. We review disaggregation algorithms and their requirements, and evaluate the extent to which smart meters can meet those requirements. Research, technology, and policy recommendations are also outlined.},

For this purpose, we implement an autoencoder neural network to create a better data representation of the power signatures. Then, we cluster the different operational programs by using a K-means algorithm fitted to the new data representation. To test our methodology, we study the operation modes of some washing machines and dishwashers whose power signatures were derived from both submeters and nonintrusive load monitoring techniques. Our clustering analysis reveals the existence of multiple working programs showing well-defined features in terms of both average energy consumption and duration. Our results can then be used to improve demand response programs by reducing their impact on the comfort of end-users. Furthermore, end-users can rely on our framework to favor lighter operation modes and reduce their overall energy consumption.},

  abstract = {The dramatic progresses of wireless technologies and wearable devices have significantly promoted the development and popularity of smart home, while digital twin (DT) emerges as a game changer benefiting from its enhanced capabilities of visualization and interaction. The DT is able to build a realtime and continuous visual replica of a physical object or process, and to provide realtime monitoring, anomaly prediction, smart interaction, and lifecycle management. This paper presents a DT model to empower healthcare monitoring in the smart home with the goals of graphical monitoring, healthcare prediction, and intelligent control. High fidelity DT of the house and its equipments is created for visualized monitoring, and two suites of devices are deployed for continuously acquiring the users’ electrocardiograph (ECG) waves and the WiFi signals in the house. Two intelligent algorithms are then developed to perform fall detection from WiFi signals and to screen atrial fibrillation from ECG waves collected by wearable devices. Experimental results well validate the proposed model’s effectiveness for smart home monitoring, and the advantages of the developed smart algorithms for healthcare prediction over counterparts.},

  abstract = {Time series data acquired from sensors deployed in smart homes present valuable information for intelligent systems to learn activity patterns of occupants. With the increasing need to enable people to age in place independently, the availability of such data is key to the development of home monitoring solutions. In this article we describe an unlabelled dataset of measurements collected from multiple environmental sensors placed in a smart home to capture human activities of daily living. Various sensors were used including passive infrared, force sensing resistors, reed switches, mini photocell light sensors, temperature and humidity, and smart plugs. The sensors record data from the user’s interactions with the environment, such as indoor movements, pressure applied on the bed, or current consumption when using electrical appliances. Millions of raw sensor data samples were collected continuously at a frequency of 1~Hz over a period of six months between 26 February 2020 and 26 August 2020. The dataset can be useful in the analysis of different methods, including data-driven algorithms for activity or habit recognition. In particular, the research community might be interested in investigating the performance of algorithms when applied on unlabelled datasets and not necessarily on annotated datasets. Furthermore, by applying artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms on such data collected over long periods, it is possible to extract patterns that reveal the user’s habits as well as detect changes in the habits. This can benefit in detecting deviations in order to provide timely interventions for patients, e.g., people with dementia.},

Interest in the intelligent management of home energy consumption using data mining and time series analysis is increasing. Therefore, this work develops an efficient web-based energy information management system for the power consumption of home appliances that monitors the energy load of a home, analyzes its energy consumption based on machine learning, and then sends information to various stakeholders. It interacts with the end-user through energy dashboards and emails. The web-based system includes a novel hybrid artificial intelligence model to improve its prediction of energy usage. An automatic warning function is also developed to identify anomalous energy consumption in a home in real time. The cloud system automatically sends a message to the user's email whenever a warning is necessary. End-users of this system can use forecast information and anomalous data to enhance the efficiency of energy usage in their buildings especially during peak times by adjusting the operating schedule of their appliances and electrical equipment.},

  abstract = {A smart home is a residence equipped with technology that observes the residents and provides proactive services. Most recently, it has been introduced as a potential solution to support independent living of people with disabilities and older adults, as well as to relieve the workload from family caregivers and health providers. One of the key supporting features of a smart home is its ability to monitor the activities of daily living and safety of residents, and in detecting changes in their daily routines. With the availability of inexpensive low-power sensors, radios, and embedded processors, current smart homes are typically equipped with a large amount of networked sensors which collaboratively process and make deductions from the acquired data on the state of the home as well as the activities and behaviors of its residents. This article reviews sensor technology used in smart homes with a focus on direct environment sensing and infrastructure mediated sensing. The article also points out the strengths and limitations of different sensor technologies, as well as discusses challenges and opportunities from clinical, technical, and ethical perspectives. It is recommended that sensor technologies for smart homes address actual needs of all stake holders including end users, their family members and caregivers, and their doctors and therapists. More evidence on the appropriateness, usefulness, and cost benefits analysis of sensor technologies for smart homes is necessary before these sensors should be widely deployed into real-world residential settings and successfully integrated into everyday life and health care services.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionising how energy is delivered from energy producers and used throughout residential households. Optimising the residential energy consumption is a crucial step toward having greener and sustainable energy production. Such optimisation requires a household-centric energy management system as opposed to a one-rule-fits all approach. In this paper, we propose a data-driven multi-layer digital twin of the energy system that aims to mirror households’ actual energy consumption in the form of a household digital twin (HDT). When linked to the energy production digital twin (EDT), HDT empowers the household-centric energy optimisation model to achieve the desired efficiency in energy use. The model intends to improve the efficiency of energy production by flattening the daily energy demand levels. This is done by collaboratively reorganising the energy consumption patterns of residential homes to avoid peak demands whilst accommodating the resident needs and reducing their energy costs. Indeed, our system incorporates the first HDT model to gauge the impact of various modifications on the household energy bill and, subsequently, on energy production. The proposed energy system is applied to a real-world IoT dataset that spans over two years and covers seventeen households. Our conducted experiments show that the model effectively flattened the collective energy demand by 20.9\% on synthetic data and 20.4\% on a real dataset. At the same time, the average energy cost per household was reduced by 10.7\% for the synthetic data and 17.7\% for the real dataset.},

  abstract = {Over the last few years, activity recognition in the smart home has become an active research area due to the wide range of human centric-applications. With the development of machine learning algorithms for activity classification, dataset is significantly important for algorithms testing and validation. Collection of real data is a challenging process due to involved budget, human resources, and annotation cost that’s why mostly researchers prefer to utilize existing datasets for evaluation purposes. However, openly available smart home datasets indicate variation in terms of performed activities, deployed sensors, and environment settings. Unfortunately, the analysis of existing datasets characteristic is a bottleneck for researchers while selecting datasets of their intent. In this paper, we develop a Framework for Smart Homes Dataset Analysis (FSHDA) to reflect their diverse dimensions in predefined format. It analyzes a list of data dimensions that covers the variations in time, activities, sensors, and inhabitants. For validation, we examine the effects of proposed data dimension on state-of-the-art activity recognition techniques. The results show that dataset dimensions highly affect the classifiers’ individual activity label assignments and their overall performances. The outcome of our study is helpful for upcoming researchers to develop a better understanding about the smart home datasets characteristics with classifier’s performance.},

We evaluated the ARIMA and TBATS statistical prediction methods and compared them with other models on datasets from a household equipped with photovoltaics and an energy management system.

This is the problem of partitioning a set of observations into clusters such that the intra-cluster observations are similar and the inter-cluster observations are dissimilar. The traditional set-up where a static dataset is available in its entirety for random access is not applicable as we do not have the entire dataset at the launch of the learning, the data continue to arrive at a rapid rate, we can not access the data randomly, and we can make only one or at most a small number of passes on the data in order to generate the clustering results. These types of data are referred to as data streams. The data stream clustering problem requires a process capable of partitioning observations continuously while taking into account restrictions of memory and time. In the literature of data stream clustering methods, a large number of algorithms use a two-phase scheme which consists of an online component that processes data stream points and produces summary statistics, and an offline component that uses the summary data to generate the clusters. An alternative class is capable of generating the final clusters without the need of an offline phase. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the data stream clustering methods and an overview of the most well-known streaming platforms which implement clustering.},

  abstract = {One of the key transformations in the epoch of the Internet of Things(IoT) and industry innovation is Digital twin. The top trending technologies like Machine learning, artificial intelligence, Cloud Computing platforms, Big data architectures, Software analytics and the Internet of things(IoT) are integrated and used by a digital twin concept in an immense way which changes the IT business productivity and reduces the cost of investment. Digital Twin is a flourishing tool which integrates the both physical and virtual scenarios/worlds. This paper presents the re-designing solution for Smart homes using the digital twin paradigm. The introduction and the concept of this technology are introduced first, and then presented a sophisticated smart home architecture with digital twin. At last we performed experiments on this digital twin architecture and compared with normal IoT implementations. In this Whitepaper, we reviewed the concepts of Digital twin technology, IoT and re-designing idea for building Smart Homes.},

The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to “normal accidents.” We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA’s current work with the Digital Twin.},

  abstract = {Machine learning approaches have diverse applications in forecasting electrical energy consumption using smart meter data. Various classification techniques and clustering methods analyze smart meter data for accurately forecasting the electrical appliance consumption and peak demand. Electrical appliance forecasting and peak demand forecasting play a vital and key role in planning, maintenance and automation development for electrical power system. However, there is always a variation between electrical appliance consumption and appliance energy demand due to certain parameters including losses in lines and appliance and mismanagement of appliance energy demand. Detail scrutiny of smart meter data is required to identify the decisive attributes and major cause of variation between electrical appliance consumption and customers’ peak demand. This paper proposed a hybrid method based on Machine learning for forecasting appliance consumption and peak demand. We have deployed faster k-medoids clustering, support vector machine and artificial neural network for forecasting appliance consumption and customers’ peak demand. The proposed algorithm achieves 99.2\% accuracy in forecasting electrical appliance consumption which is much better compared to state-of-the-art in same field. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in forecasting the electrical appliance consumption using smart meter data.},

Most current techniques for NILM are trained using significant amounts of labeled appliances power data. The collection of such data is challenging, making data a major bottleneck in creating well generalizing NILM solutions. To help mitigate the data limitations, we present the first truly synthetic appliance power signature generator. Our solution, TraceGAN, is based on conditional, progressively growing, 1-D Wasserstein generative adversarial network (GAN). Using TraceGAN, we are able to synthesise truly random and realistic appliance power data signatures. We evaluate the samples generated by TraceGAN in a qualitative way as well as numerically by using traditional GAN evaluation methods such as the Inception score. Finally, we provide a simplistic example for the use of TraceGAN as a data augmentation tool for supervised NILM training.}

  abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

We found that the Prophet model using information about the total energy consumption and real data about the energy consumption of the top 10 energy-consuming devices gave the best forecast of energy consumption for the following day. In this paper, we also presented a methodology of using decision trees and a unique set of conditional attributes to understand the errors made by the forecast model. This methodology was also proposed to reduce the number of monitored devices.

Taking into account these principles, academics may be enabled to further investigate on the topic, while practitioners may find assistance in identifying appropriate scenarios.

  abstract = {In the last decade, extended efforts have been poured into energy efficiency. Several energy consumption datasets were henceforth published, with each dataset varying in properties, uses and limitations. For instance, building energy consumption patterns are sourced from several sources, including ambient conditions, user occupancy, weather conditions and consumer preferences. Thus, a proper understanding of the available datasets will result in a strong basis for improving energy efficiency. Starting from the necessity of a comprehensive review of existing databases, this work is proposed to survey, study and visualize the numerical and methodological nature of building energy consumption datasets. A total of thirty-one databases are examined and compared in terms of several features, such as the geographical location, period of collection, number of monitored households, sampling rate of collected data, number of sub-metered appliances, extracted features and release date. Furthermore, data collection platforms and related modules for data transmission, data storage and privacy concerns used in different datasets are also analyzed and compared. Based on the analytical study, a novel dataset has been presented, namely Qatar university dataset, which is an annotated power consumption anomaly detection dataset. The latter will be very useful for testing and training anomaly detection algorithms, and hence reducing wasted energy. Moving forward, a set of recommendations is derived to improve datasets collection, such as the adoption of multi-modal data collection, smart Internet of things data collection, low-cost hardware platforms and privacy and security mechanisms. In addition, future directions to improve datasets exploitation and utilization are identified, including the use of novel machine learning solutions, innovative visualization tools and explainable mobile recommender systems. Accordingly, a novel visualization strategy based on using power consumption micro-moments has been presented along with an example of deploying machine learning algorithms to classify the micro-moment classes and identify anomalous power usage.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

This paper presents an artificial neural network approach that uses stable cost predictions as a method for dealing with upcoming price uncertainties. For making optimum and decentralized decisions for various household devices, multi-agent reinforcement learning has been used along with predicted upcoming costs. This paper conducts the simulation with shiftable, non-shiftable, and controllable loads to determine the effectiveness of this suggested EM strategy. Based on the outcomes of the experiments, this suggested DR algorithm has capable of handling EM for a number of devices, minimizing consumer electricity expenses and discomfort prices, and helping the consumer considerably reduce its energy expenses in comparison to a benchmark using no DR.},

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of three increasingly sophisticated approaches within a common framework on three data-sets each spanning 2 years. The approaches forecast the future on-off times of the appliances for the next 24~h on an hourly basis, solely based on historic energy consumption data. The appliances investigated are driven by user behavior and consume a significant fraction of the household’s total electrical energy consumption. We find that for all algorithms the average area under curve (AUC) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is in the range between 72\% and 73\%, i.e. indicating mediocre prediction quality. We conclude that historic consumption data alone is not sufficient for a good quality hourly forecast.},

This paper presentsa comprehensive review of 42 NILM datasets aided by comparison tables, generated to elaborate on the diverse features of existing datasets. Moreover, the strengths and limitations of present NILM datasets are highlighted with an outlook on present challenges and future research directions as a contribution to the field of energy disaggregation and load identification. The review will help the researchers to evaluate the performance of new NILM algorithms.

  abstract = {Electricity disaggregation, the task of inferring appliances' energy consumption in a building from a few sensing points, has received attention in the energy community. In this paper, we introduce EMBED, a publically available dataset for Energy Monitoring through Building Electricity Disaggregation. EMBED is the most comprehensive fully labeled disaggregation dataset to date containing the aggregate power measurement as well as plug load data of different appliances for three residential units, each was collected for at least two weeks. Therefore, this dataset could be used for comparing the performance for both event-based and non-even-based methodologies. In this dataset, all the events were uniquely labeled by identifying separate labels for different transition states for each appliance. This feature enables comprehensive evaluation of classification or clustering algorithms for disaggregation. The paper discusses the dataset, hardware setup, data collection procedure, and unique characteristics compared to the similar works. In addition, it presents preliminary analyses on the dataset as a benchmark to encourage future research in the disaggregation domain.},

Specifically, this study has developed a recommendation system based on a multiagent system that allows to obtain consumption data from electronic devices in a home, obtain information on electricity prices from the Internet, and provide recommendations based on consumption patterns of users and electricity prices. In this way, the system recommends new hours in which to use the appliances, offering the economic benefit that it would propose recommendations for the user. In this way, it is possible to distribute and optimize the use of energy in homes and reduce the peaks in electricity consumption.

In general, there is a lack of high-temporal-resolution data describing occupant electrical consumption that are available to researchers in this field. To address this, new measurements were performed and combined with data emanating from an earlier study to provide a database of annual measurements for 23 houses at a 1-min resolution that characterizes whole-house, non-HVAC, air conditioner, and furnace fan electrical draws, as well as the draw patterns of some major appliances. All houses were located in Ottawa, Canada. The non-HVAC measurements of this 23-house sample were shown to be in agreement with published estimates for the housing stock. The furnace fan was found to be the most significant end-use. These high-temporal-resolution data of electrical demands in houses can be used by researchers to increase the fidelity of building performance simulation analyses of different micro-generation technologies in residential buildings.},

  abstract = {Energy communities will play a central role in the sustainable energy transition by helping inform and engage end users to become more responsible consumers of energy. However, the true potential of energy communities can only be unlocked at scale. This scalability requires data-driven solutions that model not just the behaviour of building occupants but also of energy flexible resources in buildings and grid conditions in general. This understanding can then be utilized for a variety of downstream tasks such as reducing the cost and carbon intensity of electricity usage, improving the stability of the electricity grid and allowing for greater proliferation of variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. However, in practice, collecting and analysing the data necessary to realize these objectives forms a large part of such projects. This process can be considerably accelerated by utilizing open source datasets and models from similar existing projects. Likewise, a number of open source tools exist that can help practitioners achieve state of the art performance in most tasks of practical interest with minor adaptations. This review provides an overview of these open-source datasets, models and tools, and the many ways they can be utilized in optimally designing and operating real-world energy community projects. Highlights: 1. The importance of open-source datasets and tools is explained for energy communities 2. Most common use cases for open-source datasets, models and tools for energy communities are identified 3. A thorough review of open-source datasets, models and tools is presented 4.

Recently, deep neural networks have driven remarkable improvements in classification performance in neighbouring machine learning fields such as image classification and automatic speech recognition. In this paper, we adapt three deep neural network architectures to energy disaggregation: 1) a form of recurrent neural network called `long short-term memory' (LSTM); 2) denoising autoencoders; and 3) a network which regresses the start time, end time and average power demand of each appliance activation. We use seven metrics to test the performance of these algorithms on real aggregate power data from five appliances. Tests are performed against a house not seen during training and against houses seen during training. We find that all three neural nets achieve better F1 scores (averaged over all five appliances) than either combinatorial optimisation or factorial hidden Markov models and that our neural net algorithms generalise well to an unseen house.},

However, research into consumer behaviour suggests that consumers are best able to improve their energy efficiency when provided with itemised, appliance-by-appliance consumption information. Energy disaggregation is a computational technique for estimating appliance-by-appliance energy consumption from a whole-house meter signal. To conduct research on disaggregation algorithms, researchers require data describing not just the aggregate demand per building but also the ‘ground truth’ demand of individual appliances. In this context, we present UK-DALE: an open-access dataset from the UK recording Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity at a sample rate of 16\,kHz for the whole-house and at 1/6\,Hz for individual appliances. This is the first open access UK dataset at this temporal resolution. We recorded from five houses, one of which was recorded for 655 days, the longest duration we are aware of for any energy dataset at this sample rate. We also describe the low-cost, open-source, wireless system we built for collecting our dataset.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website. While there has not been a paper on the review of 1D CNNs and its applications in the literature, this paper fulfills this gap.},

Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is seen as a key technique for enabling innovative smart-grid services. By breaking down the energy consumption of households and industrial facilities into its components, NILM techniques provide information on present appliances and can be applied to perform diagnostics. As with related Machine Learning problems, research and development requires a sufficient amount of data to train and validate new approaches. As a viable alternative to collecting datasets in buildings during expensive and time-consuming measurement campaigns, the idea of generating synthetic datasets for NILM gain momentum recently. With SynD, we present a synthetic energy dataset with focus on residential buildings. We release 180 days of synthetic power data on aggregate level (i.e. mains) and individual appliances. SynD is the result of a custom simulation process that relies on power traces of real household appliances. In addition, we present several case studies that demonstrate similarity of our dataset and four real-world energy datasets.},

  abstract = {Like the current digitalization process [1], digitalization in the Smart Home and Smart Building goes beyond seeing digital systems as individual elements or isolated solutions. In principle, solutions must be developed that enable comprehensive networking and barrier-free data exchange to support the numerous new application scenarios [2]. Nowadays, in a typical smart home, there exist a large number of miscellaneous devices and systems with different characteristics. Using their sensors and actuators, these devices and systems can form an interface to the real world and can make their measurements available in near real time. Furthermore, it is possible to provide a digital representation of an entire Smart Home or Building using a socalled Digital Twin. Digital Twins can not only represent the current state of the underlying systems, but also the history of the data for learning processes in a semantic context. Hence, they can provide interfaces to AI systems in a service environment. In this paper, we present an approach which uses the WoT Thing Description (TD) as standardized by the W3C [3] as the basis for the implementation of a novel Digital Twin for Smart Homes and Buildings. The use of the standardized TD model enables interoperability across manufacturers and devices. The goal is to make extended services more flexible and dynamic on the basis of semantic device type and building descriptions of Digital Twins.},

  abstract = {Electricity forecasting is an essential component of smart grid, which has attracted increasing academic interest. Forecasting enables informed and efficient responses for electricity demand. However, various forecasting models exist making it difficult for inexperienced researchers to make an informed model selection. This paper presents a systematic review of forecasting models with the main purpose of identifying which model is best suited for a particular case or scenario. Over 113 different case studies reported across 41 academic papers have been used for the comparison. The timeframe, inputs, outputs, scale, data sample size, error type and value have been taken into account as criteria for the comparison. The review reveals that despite the relative simplicity of all reviewed models, the regression and/or multiple regression are still widely used and efficient for long and very long-term prediction. For short and very short-term prediction, machine-learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and time series analysis (including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and the Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)) are favoured. The most widely employed independent variables are the building and occupancy characteristics and environmental data, especially in the machine learning models. In many cases, time series analysis and regressions rely on electricity historical data only, without the introduction of exogenous variables. Overall, if the singularity of the different cases made the comparison difficult, some trends are clearly identifiable. Considering the large amount of use cases studied, the meta-analysis of the references led to the identification of best practices within the expert community in relation to forecasting use for electricity consumption and power load prediction. Therefore, from the findings of the meta-analysis, a taxonomy has been defined in order to help researchers make an informed decision and choose the right model for their problem (long or short term, low or high resolution, building to country level).},

This paper presents two main contributions. First, we present ContextAct@A4H, a new real-life dataset of daily living activities with rich context data (This research is supported by the Amiqual4Home Innovation Factory, http://amiqual4home.inria.frfunded by the ANR (ANR-11-EQPX-0002)). It is a high quality dataset collected in a smart apartment with a dense but non intrusive sensor infrastructure. Second, we present the experience of using temporal logic and model checking for activity recognition. Temporal logic allows specifying activities as complex events of object usage which can be described at different granularity. It also expresses temporal ordering between events thus palliating a limitation of ontology based activity recognition. The results on using the CADP toolbox for activity recognition in the real life collected data are very good.},

Even though several studies are focused on forecasting building consumption, less attention is given to forecasting the use of single appliances. Indeed, some of the energy needs of consumers may be relatively delayed or anticipated to obtain a better consumption profile while maintaining consumer comfort. This paper focuses on forecasting appliance power consumption using a non-linear autoregressive (NAR) neural network model. The results obtained on the UK-DALE public dataset demonstrate that NAR models are suitable for forecasting of energy consumption with a good accuracy. The proposed model obtained the best Mean Absolute Errors, compared with the LSTM, Autoencoder, Combinatory optimization, FHMM, and Seq2point techniques.},

  abstract = {While legacy building digital twins (DTs), such as building management systems, help building and facility managers to make informed decisions, the real end-users of buildings, i.e., occupants, have been considered as data informants without agency for access to and interaction with DT systems. This is due to the lack of multi-user interfaces for occupants to interact with building systems effectively with sufficient observability and controllability. The research on the design of multi-user interfaces has been limited to specialized services in public, shared spaces, or office-specific experiments and fails to produce detailed design principles. In this study, we explore the “democratization of DTs” as an occupant-building interface that invites occupants to monitor the building- and human-related data and make informed decisions. An occupant participatory approach was employed, consisting of a survey, an experience sampling method, and a co-design workshop, to understand occupants' current experiences with environmental controls and desired methods to interact with a DT system. The findings identified five interaction dimensions between occupants and a novel occupant-in-the-loop DT system that provides occupants with observability and controllability over building systems. Accordingly, we establish design principles for DT systems as an occupant-building interface that supports occupants’ dynamic contexts, intuitive controls, collaborative and balanced decision-making between personal comfort and energy consumption, as well as authority and data privacy.},

Using a unique household-level dataset from California, the model is applied to estimate short-run household demand for electricity and natural gas and the long-run technology choices with respect to clothes washing, water heating, space heating, and clothes drying. The estimation results support commonality of underlying preferences except in one case that is explained by an unavailable variable.},

It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for2\^{}bquanta,b=1,2, \textbackslash cdots, 7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.},

However, researchers report a lack of high-quality publicly-available datasets: conducting experiments gathering such data is long and expensive, especially if the annotation of meaningful information (environment, person's activity, health status) is required. Moreover, there are even more specific settings (e.g., dementia detection) where data must be related to a change in inhabitants' behavior. We present a collection of new publicly-available datasets generated with the SHARON simulator. Thanks to this software, researchers can obtain synthetic data suiting their specific requirements. Two classes of datasets are described: one extends existing datasets preserving the original statistical properties, the other is composed of simulations of virtual inhabitant-environment systems. Moreover, we induced behavioral drifts compatible with dementia symptoms, generating further datasets. We believe that these resources may help the progress of research, as long as new real-life high-quality datasets are not available.},

The most common disaggregation algorithms are based on the Hidden Markov Model, while solutions based on deep neural networks have recently caught the attention of researchers. In this work we address the problem through the recognition of the state of activation of the appliances using a fully convolutional deep neural network, borrowing some techniques used in the semantic segmentation of images and multilabel classification. This approach has allowed obtaining high performances not only in the recognition of the activation state of the domestic appliances but also in the estimation of their consumptions, improving the state of the art for a reference dataset.},

  abstract = {The recently employed demand-response (DR) model enabled by the transformation of the traditional power grid to the SmartGrid (SG) allows energy providers to have a clearer understanding of the energy utilisation of each individual household within their administrative domain. Nonetheless, the rapid growth of IoT-based domestic appliances within each household in conjunction with the varying and hard-to-predict customer-specific energy requirements is regarded as a challenge with respect to accurately profiling and forecasting the day-to-day or week-to-week appliance-level power consumption demand. Such a forecast is considered essential in order to compose a granular and accurate aggregate-level power consumption forecast for a given household, identify faulty appliances, and assess potential security and resilience issues both from an end-user as well as from an energy provider perspective. Therefore, in this paper we investigate techniques that enable this and propose the applicability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for short-term appliance-level power profiling and forecasting. We demonstrate their superiority over the past heavily used Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in terms of prediction accuracy and computational performance with experiments conducted over real appliance-level dataset gathered in four residential households.},

However, existing work has failed to integrate these key technologies to provide a complete smart home solution to understand user behaviors, protect user pri-vacy, and provide personalized suggestions. In addition, there are not many available smart home datasets that can support thorough studies of user behaviors in household environments. To address these critical problems, we present YouHome: the first smart home framework for developing integrated smart systems with a strong emphasis on usability, scalability, user privacy, edge/cloud coordination, and a comprehensive activities-of-daily-living (ADL) dataset to assist the smart home research. YouHome includes a flexible framework with three levels of system abstraction to collect sensor data, recognize user behavior, and generate personalized suggestions. We also establish multi-stage approaches in this work to protect user privacy effectively from threats such as data leaks. Finally, we implement an end-to-end prototype system to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework. The accompanying YouHome ADL dataset is the first annotated dataset with multiple sensing data types tailored for smart home research and applications, including video, illuminance, temperature, humidity, motion, and sound. It covers two household settings, 20 users, and 31 different activities. We have released our comprehensive dataset to enable numerous research opportunities in both smart home and machine learning communities. We also intend to open-source the framework in the future.},

Appliances should however only be disconnected from mains when no negative side effects, e.g., loss of data or thawing food, are incurred thereby. This motivates the use of appliance identification techniques, which determine the type of an attached appliance based on the continuous sampling of its power consumption. While various implementations based on different sampling resolutions have been presented in existing literature, the achievable classification accuracies have rarely been analyzed. We address this shortcoming and evaluate the accuracy of appliance identification based on the characteristic features of traces collected during the 24 hours of a day. We evaluate our algorithm using more than 1,000 traces of different electrical appliances' power consumptions. The results show that our approach can identify most of the appliances at high accuracy.},

Our approach consists in acquiring signatures at a low frequency, which contrast with high frequency transient analysis approaches that are costlier and have been well studied in former research works. Electrical consumption signatures comprise real power, reactive power, RMS current, RMS voltage, frequency and phase of voltage relative to current. A total of 225 appliances were recorded over two sessions of one hour. The database is balanced with 15 different brands/models spread into 15 categories.

In this research for Short Term Load Forecasting (STLF) it has been used Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and, despite the consumption unpredictability, it has been shown the possibility to forecast the electricity consumption of a household with certainty. The ANNs are recognized to be a potential methodology for modeling hourly and daily energy consumption and load forecasting. Input variables such as apartment area, numbers of occupants, electrical appliance consumption and Boolean inputs as hourly meter system were considered. Furthermore, the investigation carried out aims to define an ANN architecture and a training algorithm in order to achieve a robust model to be used in forecasting energy consumption in a typical household. It was observed that a feed-forward ANN and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm provided a good performance. For this research it was used a database with consumption records, logged in 93 real households, in Lisbon, Portugal, between February 2000 and July 2001, including both weekdays and weekend. The results show that the ANN approach provides a reliable model for forecasting household electric energy consumption and load profile.},

Structure and training procedure of the proposed network are explained. In regression and classification experiments on artificial data, the proposed structure gives better results than other approaches. For real data, classification experiments for phonemes from the TIMIT database show the same tendency. In the second part of this paper, it is shown how the proposed bidirectional structure can be easily modified to allow efficient estimation of the conditional posterior probability of complete symbol sequences without making any explicit assumption about the shape of the distribution.

  abstract = {Complex IoT ecosystems often require the usage of Digital Twins (DTs) of their physical assets in order to perform predictive analytics and simulate what-if scenarios. DTs are able to replicate IoT devices and adapt over time to their behavioral changes. However, DTs in IoT are typically tailored to a specific use case, without the possibility to seamlessly adapt to different scenarios. Further, the fragmentation of IoT poses additional challenges on how to deploy DTs in heterogeneous scenarios characterized by the usage of multiple data formats and IoT network protocols. In this paper, we propose the Relativistic Digital Twin (RDT) framework, through which we automatically generate general-purpose DTs of IoT entities and tune their behavioral models over time by constantly observing their real counterparts. The framework relies on the object representation via the Web of Things (WoT), to offer a standardized interface to each of the IoT devices as well as to their DTs. To this purpose, we extended the W3C WoT standard in order to encompass the concept of behavioral model and define it in the Thing Description (TD) through a new vocabulary. Finally, we evaluated the RDT framework over two disjoint use cases to assess its correctness and learning performance, i.e., the DT of a simulated smart home scenario with the capability of forecasting the indoor temperature, and the DT of a real-world drone with the capability of forecasting its trajectory in an outdoor scenario. Experiments show that the generated DT can estimate the behavior of its real counterpart after an observation stage, regardless of the considered scenario.},

Challenges to NASA missions increasingly concern operating in remote and imperfectly understood environments, and ensuring crew safety in the context of unprecedented human spaceflight mission concepts. Success turns on being able to predict the fine details of the remote environment, possibly including interactions among humans and robots. A project team needs to have thought through carefully what may go wrong, and have a contingency plan ready to go, or a generalized response that will secure the crew, spacecraft, and mission. Balanced against these engineering realities are always-advancing science and exploration objectives, as each mission returns exciting new results and discoveries, leading naturally to new science and exploration questions that in turn demand greater capabilities from future crew, spacecraft and missions. This healthy tension between engineering and system designs on the one hand, and science investigations and exploration objectives on the other results in increasing demands on the functionality of mission software and the performance of the computers that host the on-board software and analyze the rapidly growing volume of science data. Mission software and computing must become more sophisticated to meet the needs of the missions, while extreme reliability and safety must be preserved. Mission software and computing also are inherently cross-cutting, in that capabilities developed for one mission are often relevant to other missions as well, particularly those within the same class.},

It is one of the key technologies to endorse the virtual and remote intelligent control system for home-devices (HD) in human comfort (disabled/elderly). The relevant research is in the initial stage, and how to realize the DT of home-equipment control has become a vital problem to be solved. This study expounds on the suggestion and application of the DT model and summarizes the research and application progress from the aspect of the home-devices’ DT (HDDT) modeling. This modelling approach is three-staged: in terms of physical entities, virtual entities, and connectivity (data communication). The proposed model utilizes an interactive mechanism for the intelligent control of HD, by integrating DT and virtual simulation technologies to establish a human cyber-physical system (HCPS), specifically addressing the challenges associated with remote-control problems. The HCPS aims to achieve a deep integration and interface between the physical and virtual spaces of smart-device information. Using the game theory approach to create multi-physical entities and DT entities of IoT-based HD like washing machines, lamps, breakers, heaters, kitchen equipment, TV, AC, etc. The next step is to develop high-performance smart devices and build a reasonable sensing network to improve the depth and range of connection. The equipment tracking test showed that the system could control virtual reality synchronization, positional accuracy, and quality control for smart-devices development in HDDT modeling.},

  abstract = {Responsible, efficient and environmentally aware energy consumption behavior is becoming a necessity for the reliable modern electricity grid. In this paper, we present an intelligent data mining model to analyze, forecast and visualize energy time series to uncover various temporal energy consumption patterns. These patterns define the appliance usage in terms of association with time such as hour of the day, period of the day, weekday, week, month and season of the year as well as appliance-appliance associations in a household, which are key factors to infer and analyze the impact of consumers’ energy consumption behavior and energy forecasting trend. This is challenging since it is not trivial to determine the multiple relationships among different appliances usage from concurrent streams of data. Also, it is difficult to derive accurate relationships between interval-based events where multiple appliance usages persist for some duration. To overcome these challenges, we propose unsupervised data clustering and frequent pattern mining analysis on energy time series, and Bayesian network prediction for energy usage forecasting. We perform extensive experiments using real-world context-rich smart meter datasets. The accuracy results of identifying appliance usage patterns using the proposed model outperformed Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) at each stage while attaining a combined accuracy of 81.82\%, 85.90\%, 89.58\% for 25\%, 50\% and 75\% of the training data size respectively. Moreover, we achieved energy consumption forecast accuracies of 81.89\% for short-term (hourly) and 75.88\%, 79.23\%, 74.74\%, and 72.81\% for the long-term; i.e., day, week, month, and season respectively.},

Access to sensor datasets is necessary for the development of novel activity monitoring and recognition approaches. Access to such datasets is limited due to issues such as sensor cost, availability and deployment time. The use of simulated environments and sensors may address these issues and facilitate the generation of comprehensive datasets.

Focusing on the built environment, the voluntary adoption of rating systems for sustainability assessment is growing, with an increasing market value, and is perceived as a social responsibility both by public administration and by private companies. This paper proposes a framework for shifting from a static sustainability assessment to a digital twin (DT)-based and Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled dynamic approach. This new approach allows for a real-time evaluation and control of a wide range of sustainability criteria with a user-centered point of view. A pilot building, namely, the eLUX lab cognitive building in the University of Brescia, was used to test the framework with some sample applications. The educational building accommodates the daily activities of the engineering students by constantly interacting with the sensorized asset monitoring indoor comfort and air quality conditions as well as the energy behavior of the building in order to optimize the trade-off with renewable energy production. The framework is the cornerstone of a methodology exploiting the digital twin approach to support the decision processes related to sustainability through the whole building’s life cycle.},

The data was collected from 11 homes located in a composite climate zone-Hyderabad, India for 19 summer days (May) 2019. The dataset consists of 1.6 million data points and 450 AC cycles with each cycle having a runtime of more than 60 min ({$>$} 2000 compressor ON/OF cycles).

  abstract = {Providing detailed appliance level energy consumption information may lead consumers to understand their usage behavior and encourage them to optimize the energy usage. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or energy disaggregation aims to estimate appliance level energy consumption from the aggregate consumption data of households. NILM algorithms, proposed hitherto, are either centralized or do require high performance systems to derive appliance level data, owing to the computational complexity associated. This approach raises several issues related to scalability and privacy of consumer's data. In this paper, we present the Location-aware Energy Disaggregation Framework (LocED) that utilizes occupancy of users to derive accurate appliance level usage information. LocED framework limits the appliances considered for disaggregation based on the current location of occupants. Thus, LocED can provide real-time feedback on appliance level energy consumption and run on an embedded system locally at the household. We propose several accuracy metrics to study the performance of LocED. To test the robustness of LocED, we empirically evaluated it across multiple publicly available datasets. LocED has significantly high energy disaggregation accuracy while exponentially reducing the computational complexity. We also release our comprehensive dataset DRED (Dutch Residential Energy Dataset) for public use, which measures electricity, occupancy and ambient parameters of the household.},

With the increase in the number of IoT devices, it has become difficult for the user to control or operate every individual smart device into achieving some desired goal like optimized power consumption, scheduled appliance running time, etc. Furthermore, existing solutions to automatically adapt the IoT devices are not capable enough to incorporate the user behavior. This paper presents a novel approach to accurately configure IoT devices while achieving the twin objectives of energy optimization along with conforming to user preferences. Our work comprises of unsupervised clustering of devices' data to find the states of operation for each device, followed by probabilistically analyzing user behavior to determine their preferred states. Eventually, we deploy an online reinforcement learning (RL) agent to find the best device settings automatically. Results for three different smart homes' data-sets show the effectiveness of our methodology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a practical approach has been adopted to achieve the above mentioned objectives without any human interaction within the system.},

  abstract = {Residential load forecasting has been an intractable problem due to the small load scale and strong randomness of residents' power consumption behaviors. The traditional methods only use load data at household-level and cannot adequately consider the power consumption habits of users, so the forecasting effect is limited. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a bottom-up approach considering the load characteristic of the appliance-level. The novelty lies in the following three aspects: 1) considering the working principles and load characteristic of appliances, household appliances are classified into continuous and intermittent load appliances, to achieve more refined load forecasting by aggregating loads of appliances; 2) considering the fluctuation of load curves, the seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on Loess (STL) is applied to continuous load appliances to obtain more fine-grained and regular load data, which can give full play to the advantage of gated recurrent unit (GRU) for time series prediction; 3) in order to take power consumption behavior of users and correlations of appliances into account, a multi-task learning (MTL) network is designed for intermittent load appliances, and the model can enhance computing efficiency by predicting multiple appliances simultaneously. Case studies show that the proposed method can effectively reduce error of residential load forecasting.},

  abstract = {Real-world domestic electricity demand datasets are the key enabler for developing and evaluating machine learning algorithms that facilitate the analysis of demand attribution and usage behavior. Breaking down the electricity demand of domestic households is seen as the key technology for intelligent smart-grid management systems that seek an equilibrium of electricity supply and demand. For the purpose of comparable research, we publish DEDDIAG, a domestic electricity demand dataset of individual appliances in Germany. The dataset contains recordings of 15 homes over a period of up to 3.5 years, wherein total 50 appliances have been recorded at a frequency of 1\,Hz. Recorded appliances are of significance for load-shifting purposes such as dishwashers, washing machines and refrigerators. One home also includes three-phase mains readings that can be used for disaggregation tasks. Additionally, DEDDIAG contains manual ground truth event annotations for 14 appliances, that provide precise start and stop timestamps. Such annotations have not been published for any long-term electricity dataset we are aware of.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of IoTs and ICT technologies, smart objects become a rising commodity in our life. Several innovative smart objects and concepts are constantly proposed to the market and to crowd-funding platforms. Most of these products have similar features, with added sensors, actuators, memory capabilities, and they can exchange information with a smart phone, allowing users to control them at a distance and to collect data in everyday life. There are two typologies of smart objects: traditional products updated by implanted digital technologies; brand new products designed to meet a specific demand. In this paper, we focus on the smart objects for home, such as smart power plugs, smart surveillance systems, smart lamps, etc., and on user behaviours. The user experiences associated to the two typologies are different: the first typology should improve an existing habit, while the second should provide a fresh action. The latter create new behaviours and the paper investigates the correlation between behaviours induced by the innovative products and their success/failure. The research is mainly based on the analysis of several smart objects proposed on the market and on crowdfunding platforms. The analysis considers usability, interactive modes and the modalities of control. The goal is to extract knowledge on how to design the next generation of “smarter” home objects, i.e. not only intelligent, connected and controllable at a distance, but also requiring acceptable changes in behaviours.},

  abstract = {At present, the integration of green building, the intelligent building industry and high-quality development are facing a series of new opportunities and challenges. This review aims to analyze the digital development of smart green buildings to make it easier to create contiguous ecological development areas in green ecological cities. It sorts out the main contents of Intelligent Green Buildings (IGB) and summarizes the application and role of Digital Twins (DTs) in intelligent buildings. Firstly, the basic connotations and development direction of IGB are deeply discussed, and the current realization and applications of IGB are analyzed. Then, the advantages of DTs are further investigated in the context of IGB for DT smart cities. Finally, the development trends and challenges of IGB are analyzed. After a review and research, it is found that the realization and application of IGB have been implemented, but the application of DTs remains not quite integrated into the design of IGB. Therefore, a forward-looking design is required when designing the IGBs, such as prioritizing sustainable development, people’s livelihoods and green structures. At the same time, an IGB can only show its significance after the basic process of building the application layer is performed correctly. Therefore, this review contributes to the proper integration of IGB and urban development strategies, which are crucial to encouraging the long-term development of cities, thus providing a theoretical basis and practical experience for promoting the development of smart cities.},

  abstract = {Finding useful patterns in large datasets has attracted considerable interest recently, and one of the most widely studied problems in this area is the identification of               clusters,               or densely populated regions, in a multi-dimensional dataset. Prior work does not adequately address the problem of large datasets and minimization of I/O costs.This paper presents a data clustering method named               BIRCH               (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies), and demonstrates that it is especially suitable for very large databases.               BIRCH               incrementally and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the available resources (i.e., available memory and time constraints).               BIRCH               can typically find a good clustering with a single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a few additional scans.               BIRCH               is also the first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle "noise" (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.We evaluate               BIRCH               's time/space efficiency, data input order sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments. We also present a performance comparisons of               BIRCH               versus               CLARANS,               a clustering method proposed recently for large datasets, and show that               BIRCH               is consistently superior.},
